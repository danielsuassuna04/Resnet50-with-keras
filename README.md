Overview
The notebook provided in this repository (ResNet.ipynb) includes:

Model Architecture: Construction of a ResNet model using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).
Data Preprocessing: Handling image data and preparing it for input into the ResNet model.
Training Loop: Detailed steps for training the ResNet model on a dataset, including loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimization.
Evaluation: Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics, along with visualization of the results.
Use of Residual Blocks: The notebook demonstrates the core idea of using residual blocks to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.
